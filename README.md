# NetProbe

**Real-World Network Diagnostics from the CLI.**  
Probe latency, download speed, upload speed, and detect ISP throttling.

## Features (MVP)

- Latency test (ping with min/avg/max/packet loss)
- Single-thread download test (real download speed)
- Multi-thread download test (burst potential)
- Upload test
- Result comparison (detect throttling or network issues)
- CLI-friendly logs and history

## Why NetProbe?

Most speed tests hide the truth.  
NetProbe tells you **exactly what your ISP is doing** by comparing real and theoretical speeds.
